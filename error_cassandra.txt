Could not find or load main class cassandra\apache-cassandra-3.11.2\conf\hotspot_compiler
=========================================================================================

Seems like there is a bug in cassandra`s cassandra-env.ps1 script. 
Open cassandra-env.ps1 present under cassandra_home/conf and check line number 380 where it is setting up JVM_OPTS.

This trick worked for me when I replace line here 

From: $env:JVM_OPTS = "$env:JVM_OPTS -XX:CompileCommandFile=$env:CASSANDRA_CONF\hotspot_compiler"
To: $env:JVM_OPTS = "$env:JVM_OPTS -XX:CompileCommandFile=""$env:CASSANDRA_CONF\hotspot_compiler"""

At other places this case was well handled.

Below is the issue link created to get this fix in the future releases.
